    <h1>Blender World shaders</h1>
    <p>
        As soon as I learned that you could <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.79/data_system/files/startup_file.html">override everything for blender's default scene</a>, I knew I had to make some key personalizations.
        First and foremost, I wanted an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image-based_lighting">IBL setup</a>.
        Since most of my concepts take place in an outdoor city environment, I found an urban HDRI on <a href="https://hdri-haven.com/category/outdoor/urban?page=3">HDRI haven</a> and dumped it into my startup file.
        I added a world shader that resamples the image and darkens the darkest shadows for a more painterly effect.

        <img slot="first" src="/assets/images/old_painted_hdri.jpg" width="100%">
    </img-comparison-slider>
    <img src="/assets/images/painterly_node_tree.jpg" />

    <p>
        I've been using this setup for about 2 years tho, so it seems like it's time for a new one.
        Since I've also been playing around with some pixel art, a pixel shader seems appropriate.
        I used <a href="https://hdreye.app/">an app</a> to take an HDRI from a roof it did a bunch of hard stitching work and shat out some great assets for me to use.
        Then I do a quick downscale upscale with pixelization in the world shader, reduce the number of colors used (with posterization), and do some curve fiddling to make the colors look nice.
    </p>
    <img-comparison-slider tabindex="0" class="rendered">
        <img slot="first" src="/assets/images/pixl_hdri.jpg" width="100%">
        <img slot="second" src="/assets/images/pixl_hdri_pre.jpg" width="100%">
    </img-comparison-slider>
    <img src="/assets/images/pixl_node_tree.jpg" />
    <p>
        And we can play around with making stuff more or less pixelated.
    </p>
    <img-comparison-slider tabindex="0" class="rendered">
        <img slot="first" src="/assets/images/pixl_hdri.jpg" width="100%">
        <img slot="second" src="/assets/images/pixl_hdri_2.jpg" width="100%">
    </img-comparison-slider>
    <p>
        And that all works fine for a background,
        but the real magic happens when we zoom in on particular areas
        and tweak everything to match.
