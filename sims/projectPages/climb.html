        Climb is pretty cool, one of the many orgs looking at how to fund
        education that fits our strange modern world.

        When I was there, it was growing from a small startup (~20ppl) to a
        slightly less-small startup (last I checked, around 40ppl).

        Our team was small and we wore a lot of hats. Some tasks:
        <ul>
            <li>Correcting data entry errors, ensuring data cleanliness, etc.</li>
            <li>Updating databases to fit new business needs (e.g. expanding to additional legal territories, educational categories)</li>
            <li>General code maintenance, cleaning, refactoring</li>
            <li>I added the annoying GDPR cookie thing when that dropped back in like 2019</li>
            <li>Made a very cool <a href="https://climbcredit.com/farts" target="_blank">404 page</a> (cat design by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rachel-seitz/" target="_blank">Rachel Seitz</a>)</li>
            <li>Taught a handful of Climb U classes (weekly knowledge-sharing sessions)</li>
        </ul>
