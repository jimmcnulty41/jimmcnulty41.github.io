      text: '<div class="markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert dark"><p>Microphony refers to the phenomenon of an electronic component or a circuit picking up mechanical vibrations or sound waves and converting them into an unwanted electrical signal. Accidental microphones and antennas are created in circuits when a component or a section of the circuit is mechanically sensitive and converts mechanical vibrations or sound waves into an electrical signal.</p><p>The most common type of component that can act as an accidental microphone is the capacitor. Capacitors are made of two conductive plates separated by a dielectric material, and they store energy in an electric field. If the capacitor is subjected to mechanical vibrations or sound waves, the plates can move relative to each other, creating a change in the electric field and generating an unwanted electrical signal.</p><p>Similarly, inductors can also act as accidental microphones if they have a magnetic core that can move relative to the coil. The movement of the core creates a change in the magnetic field and generates an unwanted electrical signal.</p><p>Printed circuit boards (PCBs) can also act as accidental antennas if they are not designed properly. A PCB can pick up electromagnetic waves from the environment and generate an unwanted electrical signal. The size and shape of the PCB, as well as the placement and routing of the traces, can affect its sensitivity to electromagnetic waves.</p><p>In addition to components and PCBs, other mechanical structures in a circuit can also act as accidental microphones or antennas. For example, the housing or the mechanical supports for a circuit can vibrate and generate unwanted electrical signals.</p><p>To avoid accidental microphony and antenna effects in circuits, it is important to design circuits with mechanical stability in mind. Components and PCB layouts should be chosen to minimize the sensitivity to mechanical vibrations and sound waves, and mechanical structures should be designed to minimize vibrations. Shielding can also be used to protect sensitive components and circuits from unwanted electromagnetic interference.</p></div>',
