<p>In EECS 494, Computer Game Design and Development, our first project was to recreate a classic NES game from the ground up.</p>

<p>Gilad Naamani and I worked together over the course of roughly a month to put together a remake of Little Nemo: The Dream Master. While the game we ended up with was a little rough around the edges, considering it was the first game that either of us made, I think it turned out quite well. The motion of Nemo matches the originally quite well, and we were able to capture a lot of the spirit of the game without necessarily copying every unnecessary detail.</p>

<p>In addition to a re-creation of the first level of the game, we also created an original level where we introduced a new mechanic. We added a flying squirrel, because we felt it fit with the spirit of the game, but also provided more freedom than many of the original animals provided.</p>
