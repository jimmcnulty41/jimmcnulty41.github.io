<p>In the summer of 2014, I was lucky enough to take 2 road trips across America with some of my best friends. We were able to capture a lot of the road trip from California back home to Michigan on video, and I edited a short montage to help capture what it was like.</p>

<p>Apologies for the shaky camera; didn't have the budget for a camcorder or steadycam</p>
