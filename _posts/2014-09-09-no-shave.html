<p>The No-Shave November for Consent Campaign began in 2011 at the University of Michigan. In 2013, as co-coordinator of the Sexual Assault Prevention and Awareness Center's Men's Activism Program, I managed more than 30 student volunteers to help make our campaign as successful as possible. </p>

<p>That year's campaign was larger than it had been in any previous years. The program held 3 different events during the month and had higher participation than it had in previous years. At the end of the month, we held a football-tournament/consent-and-sexual-assault-workshop hybrid event which allowed us to reach members of more than 6 different fraternities and helped to build stronger ties between our organization and the greek community. The Michigan Daily did a piece on the event:</p>

<p>In 2014, a colleague and I developed a website to serve as a hub for the campaign. We were experimenting that year with the idea of a competition, where students would get points for attending events, wearing SAPAC merchandise, and recruiting friends to the campaign. Throughout the month of November, the site (pictured above) received more than 240 unique users and more than 1,600 page views. The site helped to drive over 100 people to sign up for the email list.</p>
